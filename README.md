# Introduction
Home Connect allows you to control your BSH (Bosch, Siemens, and others) devices over the internet. You can find more information on Home Connect here: https://www.home-connect.com/global.

I have developed this software using the information that is available on: https://developer.home-connect.com/.

Verhaeg.IoT.HomeConnect.Client allows you to communicate with your appliance. At this moment it provides authentication using 
the oAuth device authentication flow: https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/ and you are able to retrieve information on your washer appliance from the Home
Connect cloud. I will add event capabilities in the near future.

I've only tested the client on the Bosch WAXH2K75NL/01, but it should work with other appliances as well. I will test its capabilities for a dishwasher 
as soon as I have this up and running (probably by the end of 2022).

# Usage
To be done. Send me a question if you want to have information on how to use this client.
